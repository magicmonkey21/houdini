Well, look what the stork brung (what?)
Little baby devil with the forked tongue
And it's stickin' out, yeah, like a sore thumb (bleh)
With a forehead that it grew horns from (look)
Still a white jerk (it's him), pullin' up in a Chrysler to the cypher
With the Vics, Percs and a Bud Light shirt
Lyrical technician (yeah), an electrician (yeah)
Y'all light work
